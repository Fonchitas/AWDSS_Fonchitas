      <h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Bootstrap <span class="badge node">🌐 No Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>Bootstrap is kind of a classic. It was one of the first things I heard about when I started learning web design, and even though there are newer tools now, it’s still useful. I like how it helps you build layouts quickly without getting too complicated.
        That said, a lot of websites made with Bootstrap tend to look pretty similar, so I’d only use it for quick projects or when I just need something clean and functional. It’s practical, but not very flexible when it comes to creativity.</p>

        <h3>TailwindCSS <span class="badge node">📦 Requires Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>TailwindCSS is honestly amazing. I love how it gives you full control of the design directly from the HTML, you can shape everything exactly how you want. At first, the utility classes can be overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it, it’s actually super intuitive.
        It fits really well with how I like to work: I enjoy tweaking the visual details and building something that feels like mine. Plus, it’s perfect if you want to mix it with motion or more artistic layouts.</p>

    <section id="component-libraries">
      <h2>Component Libraries</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Material UI <span class="badge node">📦 Requires Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>Material UI gives me a sense of order and structure. It’s clean and professional, and it has that typical Google product feeling, very functional and balanced.
        It’s great for projects where clarity and consistency matter, but sometimes it feels a bit too strict visually. I’d use it for serious or client-oriented projects, where function and accessibility are more important than visual experimentation.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Shadcn UI <span class="badge node">📦 Requires Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>Shadcn UI feels much more modern and customizable. I love that it works perfectly with Tailwind and still lets you design your components your own way.
        The style really fits the kind of visual identity I like, minimalist, clean, and with attention to typography and space. It’s the kind of tool I’d use when I want a project to feel personal and refined at the same time.</p>

    <section id="static-site-generators">
      <h2>Static Site Generators</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Jekyll <span class="badge ruby">🟥 Requires Ruby</span></h3>
        <p>Jekyll is interesting mainly because it’s one of the pioneers in static site generation and works easily with GitHub Pages.
        I don’t love the Ruby setup part, but I like the idea of having a lightweight website without databases or complex systems. It’s perfect for something like a simple blog or documentation. Visually it’s not as flexible, but I can appreciate its simplicity.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Hugo <span class="badge standalone">🟢 Standalone</span></h3>
        <p>Hugo feels like a refreshing alternative, fast, simple, and independent from Node.js. I like tools like this that just work and don’t need too much setup.
        It’s ideal for small personal projects or portfolios that focus on content rather than complex functionality. It might not have as many styling options, but its speed and minimalism are really appealing.</p>

    <section id="animation-libraries">
      <h2>Animation Libraries</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>GSAP <span class="badge node">🌐 No Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>GSAP is one of my favorites. I love how motion can bring a website to life without making it feel overloaded, and GSAP gives you that level of creative control.
        It’s nice that you can use it straight from a CDN, no installation needed. I’d use it to add small, meaningful animations to a personal project or portfolio, especially when I want to give a dynamic and expressive feeling to the visuals.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Framer Motion <span class="badge node">📦 Requires Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>Framer Motion feels smoother and more modern, especially for React projects. I like how natural its transitions look, it’s the kind of motion that feels designed.
        Even though I’m not a React expert yet, I’d love to learn more about it. It’s perfect for when I want my design to have that fluid, seamless experience, the kind of detail that makes a site feel professional and well thought out.</p>
      </article>

    <section id="templates">
      <h2>Templates and UI Kits</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>HTML5 UP <span class="badge node">🌐 No Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>HTML5 UP is perfect for quick, good-looking setups. You can grab a template and start building right away, no installation or complex setup needed.
        I like that it’s so accessible and visually solid. It’s ideal for student projects or personal sites where I want to focus on the message rather than the technical side. It’s the type of tool that helps me move fast and still make something that looks good.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Flowbite <span class="badge node">📦 Requires Node.js</span></h3>
        <p>Flowbite feels more up-to-date and works really well with TailwindCSS, which makes it consistent visually.
        I like how the components are ready to use but still customizable. Even though it needs Node.js, I don’t really mind, it gives you more control in the end. It’s the kind of kit I’d use for a modern, clean website that needs to look professional but still have some personality.</p>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h2>Critical Reflection (ATELIER)</h2>
      <p>After exploring all these tools, I’ve realized that I work best with the ones that give me creative freedom, like TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI. I enjoy being able to adjust everything visually and build something that feels like my own.
      I also understand the value of frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI, especially when structure and usability come first, but personally, I’m more motivated by design systems that leave room for experimentation.</p>

      <p>Finding the balance between simplicity and flexibility is key for me. Sometimes the simplest tools, like HTML5 UP or Hugo, let me focus on the content and storytelling, while others, like Tailwind or Framer Motion, give me room to explore and refine the visual experience.</p>

      <p>In the end, I see these tools like instruments, each one fits a different song. Depending on the project, I can choose whether I want something more technical, more expressive, or a bit of both. That’s the creative part I enjoy the most.</p>
